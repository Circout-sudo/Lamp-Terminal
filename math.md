# Using the math command

This README provides an overview of how to use the math command in Lamp terminal. It covers basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as decimal operations. Let's get started!

## Arithmetic Operations

Lamp Terminal supports the following arithmetic operations:

### Addition

To perform addition, use the `+` operator:

```
2+2 = 4
```

### Subtraction

To perform subtraction, use the `-` operator:

```
 5 - 2 = 3
```
### Multiplication

To perform multiplication, use the `*` operator:

```
2 * 3 = 6
```
### Division

To perform division, use the `/` operator:
```
10 / 3 = 3.3333333333333335
```
```
10  //  3 = 3
```
## Decimal Operations
To perform decimal operations with decimal numbers, use the `Decimal` class:

### Decimal Addition
```
Decimal('0.3') + Decimal('0.3') = 0.6
```
### Decimal Subtraction

```
Decimal('0.2') - Decimal('0.3') = -0.1
```

### Decimal Multiplication

```
Decimal('0.3') * Decimal('0.2') = 0.06
```

### Decimal Division

```
Decimal('0.6')	/ Decimal('0.2') = 3
```
